#Donation and Vaccine- A Web based App for HackNITP
The product is a web based app and chatbot for organ, plasma and blood donation and COVID-19 vaccine program registration. I have done web development, mainly frontend, using html, css, js, bootstrap. I am a beginner and just learnt these an also tried to learn PHP and My SQL and tried simple backend work with php and mySqL but it did not stand out well so I omitted it. For building the chatbot I learned and used Google dialogflow. I have tried to do as mauch background animation, colour change gradient, gallery of images, effects on images, slideshow, video, etc in my website. This website is for a noble cause to let people easily communicate and donate organ, blood to save many lives. After this hackathon gets over, I will not stop learning and definitely build the backend as well and enhance my website to launch it successfully for the people in need. And this project also aims to create a live updated correct database for the covid-19 vaccine program which will help the decision makers in proper resource allocation and planning (as existing sources like voter list and census is faulty to an extent) of the vaccination program effectively.
